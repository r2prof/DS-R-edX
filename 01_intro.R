# For example, we just showed how to use the mouse to start a new script, 
# but you can also use a key binding: Ctrl+Shift+N on Windows and 
# command+shift+N on the Mac.

# Run button on the upper right side of the editing pane. 
# You can also use the key binding: Ctrl+Shift+Enter
# To run one line at a time instead of the entire script, 
# you can use Control-Enter
